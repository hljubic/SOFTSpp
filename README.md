# (In Review) SOFTS++: Fast and Accurate Linear Model for Multivariate Long-Term Time Series Forecasting

The code repository for "SOFTS++: Fast and Accurate Linear Model for Multivariate Long-Term Time Series Forecasting" in PyTorch. This paper and repository is based on SOFTS paper (https://github.com/Secilia-Cxy/SOFTS).

## Datasets

You can directly download the datasets used in the paper from [Google Drive] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QPM7MMKlzVffdzbGGkzARDuIqiYRed_f?usp=drive_link) or [NJU Box](https://box.nju.edu.cn/d/abc2bbd7cff6461eb4da/). 

Once downloaded, place the datasets under folder `dataset/`, like `dataset/ETT-small`, `dataset/traffic`, etc.
